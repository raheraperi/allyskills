### User stories:
1. As an Ally, I want to assess myself against metrics which give me an indication on how progressed I am along my allyship journey and where I might improve.

2. As an Ally, I want a safe, non-judgemental place to share my experiences of allyship in the workplace.

3. As an Ally, I want access to relevant, accessible and informative articles/resources to inform myself better on issues that are important to those who are members of marginalised groups and communities.
